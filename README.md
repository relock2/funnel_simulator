# Simple Funnel Simulator

This is a simple desktop tool that allows the user to estimate the range of possible new employees generated by passing a chosen number of candidates through the recruiting funnel. The user is able to compare two different funnels at the same time, inputting different parameters for the starting number of candidates and the conversion rates at each stage.

Each stage is modeled as a binomial process, with the success rate determined by the user. The number of trials is determined by the number of candidates (first stage) or the number of successes from the previous stage (all other stages).

The output provides the user with the distribution of employees from each simulation, with the median labeled as a black line and the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles marked as red dotted lines.

The user can use this tool to test the impact of changes in the funnel. For example, Funnel B below has a 5.5% lower conversion rate than Funnel A at every stage, but the same median number of employees and a higher probability of obtaining 5 employees due to its starting count of candidates.

Using this tool, users can input data about their current funnel and compare against combinations of feasible interventions to estimate the increases in hires they would see by making changes.
